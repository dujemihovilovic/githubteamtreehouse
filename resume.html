        <h2>Education</h2>
        <ul class="ikone">
            <li><h3><b>High School</b></h3>
            I finished school for Computer Technician For Mechanical Engineering. Here I learned my first 
            lines of code in C++. At sophomore year I joined to <b>Robotics</b> team where I start to learn about <b>Java</b>.
            Junior and Senior year I competed at National tournament and won 2 times. </li>
          
            <li><h3><b>College</b></h3>
            After graduation from High School I moved to Croatian capital town Zagreb and there I started to study <b>Computer Engineering</b>.
            At my freshman year I decided to start learning about FrontEnd skills and kept doing that for next 2 years. Unfortunately in the meantime 
            I beacame professional skipper and that was my childhood passion so I spent 10 years on the sea driving different sort of boats while passively 
            learning new IT skills and developing them.</li>
